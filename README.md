# Sara Hines Developer Portfolio

## Description

While I am building skills in software and web development, I created this portfolio project to practice my growing skills and to provide samples of my work for connections and potential employers to view. The HTML contains semantic elements, proprerly nested for readability and accuracy, and the CSS selects for elements, classes, and ID's to apply styling. I learned and practiced many new skills creating this project, including: how to contain and style flex elements to create a desired page layout; how to use the :hover selector; how to use the background-blend-mode and transition CSS properties; how to create a link to an email address, and how to create a link to a pdf document; and how to build with responsive design in mind. I look forward to refining this page over time and displaying increasingly advanced work as I progress!

## Installation

No installation is required to view this project. 

## Usage and Features 

To view this project, navigate to the deployed page at [https://sara-hines.github.io/sara-hines-developer-portfolio/] (https://sara-hines.github.io/sara-hines-developer-portfolio/ 'GitHub Pages Link').

* I built this project as part of my coursework with University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, and I aimed to achieve a similar appearance and functionality as a provided animated mock-up, which can be viewed below. I challenged myself to create something very similar in appearance to the mock-up. This was an interesting exercise for me as a beginner, and attempting to achieve an appearance similar to the page in color and design, including the striped banner and the responsive brightening effect on the boxes, guided my learning.  

![demo](https://github.com/sara-hines/sara-hines-developer-portfolio/assets/90005274/cf61761a-8cbb-4318-b4ee-7c6212a58883)

* When viewing the web page, the following describes the general appearance and functionality of the site:

    * The text, "Sara Hines: Developer Porfolio" appears in the header in a large font, and links appear along the nav bar. The "About Me" link navigates to the "About Me" section within the web page; the "Work" link navigates to the "Work" section within the web page; the "Contact Me" link navigates to the "Contact Me" section of the web page, and the "Resume" link navigates to a pdf of my resume.
    * An "About Me" section appears below the header and banner, with the title of the section and paragraphs comprising the section separated by a vertical line. A photo of me appears to the right of the paragraphs.
    * A "Work" section appears next on the page sequentially. Within the "Work" section, the section title appears on the left, with large box taking up the full viewport width which displays and links to my first project, a code refactor for a fictional Marketing Agency Website. Two rows of boxes appear next, which are placemarks for future projects to be added. 
    * A "Contact Me" section appears at the bottom of the page with links to my contact information for various platforms.
    * The web page uses a color pallete mostly comprised of a dark blue/brown, a turquise color, and a light grey.
    * When the user hovers over a link, whether within the nav bar or within the "Contact Me" section, the font color changes to fuschia. This effect can be viewed in the following animations.

    * When the user hovers over one of the boxes in the "Work" section, the slightly dark background color overlay set on the background image is removed, and a slightly brighter background color overlay is added. These changes happen via the transition CSS property and use ease-in-out, creating a soft, subtle brightening effect. The following animation shows this effect on the first box in the "Work" section.

    I attempted to use responsive web design while relying mainly on flexbox, and tried to rely on percentages and vw and vh units rather than units like pixels. I'm anticipating I will likely adjust and add media queries in the future for improved design across devices. 

    The below screenshots show the appearance of the web page at the full viewport width of my laptop, 1440px.
