                <section class="about-me-paragraphs">
                <p>Hi! My name is Sara Hines, and you've landed on my developer portfolio, a project which is evolving with me as I grow my knowledge of web and software development. I come from an environmental sciences background--Bachelor of Science in Ecosystem and Sustainability from Colorado State University--, and am studying software development with the aim to merge my interest in sustainability with my growing passion for software engineering.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While I am building skills and training in software development with University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, I am working as a relocation associate with Graebel Companies, Inc. I support 3 relocation consultants, including our team's Executive Consultant, and am entrusted with files from some of our highest priority clients including Eli Lilly and Company. My current role in the relocation industry allows me to work in a customer-facing capacity as well as a more internal capacity; much of my position involves managing relocation data and improving data quality. I'm at my most energized when solving problems on the "backend" side, and I love the challenge of a new and complex problem.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once I have a solid grasp of coding fundamentals, I would love to support a sustainability focused or greentech company, supporting them with their software engineering needs. I'm thrilled to be part of a community of learners with DU's Full Stack Coding program, and am excited to delve deeper into the world of software engineering!</p>
